**Mapping wetland hydrological dynamics using Google Earth Engine (GEE)**

Author: Qiusheng Wu (https://wetlands.io | wqs@binghamton.edu)

DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1432883

This repo was created to share the Google Earth Engine source code and results for the following manuscript currently under review at *Remote Sensing of Environment*. 

* **Wu, Q.**, Lane, C.R., Li, X., Zhao, K., Zhou, Y., Clinton, N., DeVries, B., Golden, H.E., & Lang, M.W. (2018). Integrating LiDAR data and multi-temporal aerial imagery to map wetland inundation dynamics on Google Earth Engine. *Remote Sensing of Environment*. (under review)

## Source Code

We have developed a GUI application (**Wetland Hydrology Analyst**) for mapping wetland inundation dynamics using multi-temporal aerial imagery and LiDAR data. The application can be found in our public GEE repository. To access the application, visit this URL: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/giswqs/public). It will add the users/giswqs/public repository to your GEE account. Once added, the repository can be found within the Reader permission group of your GEE scripts library. There you’ll find the user interface application - **Wetland Hydrology Analyst**.

Alternatively, you can directly open the application via the link below:
