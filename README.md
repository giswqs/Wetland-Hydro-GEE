**Mapping wetland hydrological dynamics using Google Earth Engine (GEE)**

Author: Qiusheng Wu (https://wetlands.io | https://lidarblog.com)

This repo was created to share the Google Earth Engine App for the following paper published in the journal *Remote Sensing of Environment*. 

* **Wu, Q.**, Lane, C.R., Li, X., Zhao, K., Zhou, Y., Clinton, N., DeVries, B., Golden, H.E., & Lang, M.W. (2019). Integrating LiDAR data and multi-temporal aerial imagery to map wetland inundation dynamics on Google Earth Engine. *Remote Sensing of Environment*. (accepted)

## Google Earth Engine Apps

We have developed a GUI application (**Wetland Hydrology Analyst**) for mapping wetland inundation dynamics using multi-temporal aerial imagery and LiDAR data. To access the application, visit this URL: https://wqs.users.earthengine.app/view/wetland-hydro-gee

To request the GEE source code for this application, please submit through this [Google Form](https://gishub.org/2018-RSE-GEE-Form).
